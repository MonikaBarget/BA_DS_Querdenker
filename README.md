# BA_DS_Querdenker

# Purpose of the repository

This repository contains data sets and visualisations relating to the social media communication of the German "Querdenker" movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected and analysed for the BA thesis in "Digital Society", submitted by Deborah Helmich at Maastricht University in 2022. The visualisations are based on distant reading with <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant Tools</a>.

Data tables in EXCEL format need to be downloaded before viewing. CSV files can be opened and viewed directly on GitHub.
