# Purpose of the repository

This repository contains data sets and visualisations relating to the social media communication of the German "Querdenker" movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected and analysed for the BA thesis in "Digital Society", submitted by Deborah Helmich at Maastricht University in 2022. The visualisations are based on distant reading with <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant Tools</a>.

# Thesis abstract

During the Covid-19 pandemic, voices quickly rose in opposition to the measures taken to contain the virus. The Querdenker movement is a German heterogeneous group in which supporters from different social classes spread theories against the Covid-19 measures. Using over 20,000 posts gathered from Twitter, this study analyses how this group interacts on social media and disseminates its theories. The dataset is examined in the framework of a discourse analysis while using the programme Voyant Tools to create visualisations as a digital element from a distant reading approach and bringing the findings into context by conducting a text analysis for individual tweets. It is shown that a broad spectrum of the Querdenker movement is represented in the dataset with different narratives aiming to address a wide range of society. The strategies used to disseminate their theories include the use of unreliable sources, out-of-context citations and false claims while increasing their reach by using hashtags and replies to twitter channels with a great audience.
